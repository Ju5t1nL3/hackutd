# ResuMate
### For students, by students

## Inspiration
We are all worried about getting internships, and even though we have each other, it would be nice to have people who were in our position to give us advice on how to achieve the internships and work we want.

## What it does
Users upload their resumes and/or cover letters, and other people give feedback on how to structure and word their resumes or tell them what they could be improving on. People can give advice on what activities/subjects to focus on which will help others get the internship they want.

## How we built it
We used Pinata to take users' resumes to be stored to an API and store it until someone requests to view it for feedback or to give feedback.

## Challenges we ran into
Getting used to Pinata was difficult and developing so much front end was also difficult. There are a lot of different files and pieces that have to come together in order to get the website to work, so it took a lot of Error 404s and incomplete builds before we got something that worked.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're happy with developing a backend that helps store the login and data of users so that they can keep their feedback that people give them.

## What we learned
We learned a lot of front-end design and got experience with working with designing websites with multiple people and with more than just a few pages.

## What's next for ResuMate
Next we hope to implement a video recording system to have a similar feedback system but for interviews, since those would be the next step in the recruiting process. Additionally, we're hoping to get a recruiter role so that they would have a role in helping students improve on activities.
